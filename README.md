- Shared budget & purchases: Simplifies collective expense control.
- Shared playlist: Creates a collaborative musical atmosphere using Spotify.  
- Group and private chat: Enables instant communication.
- Share the party/event with other people that aren’t in the organisation
- Research public parties that are close to your location 
- Party rating & review system ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Party tag for what kind of party it is (this is set up by the organiser)
- Weather Info: Have a bar that indicates if and when it's going to rain (plus reminder)
- Permission Handling: One admin (creates event), multiple possible organisers (added later on) and event goers (who don’t have access to the organisation part of the event). 
- Car pooling : number of seats, departure time, destination, etc.. ,  “trust me I am not drunk”
- Organizing who can sleep on site with reservation
